        <h1> A Handmade Web <span class="author">j. r. Carpenter</span></h1>

       <div class="response2">In A Handmade Web, J. R. Carpenter discusses the importance of maintaining personalized, self-authored websites in contrast to today’s dominant platform-based internet. We are currently living in a time where almost everyone has an online presence or digital identity, however most users are unaware of the infrastructures, labor, and policies that shape how their identities are hosted, circulated, and controlled. Carpenter uses the term “handmade web” to advocate for an ongoing, active engagement with both the making of web pages and the politics of the web itself. As she writes in the article, in the early days of the social web, there was an expectation that individuals would own their online identities through personal websites rather than relying on a few large platforms. During this time, when handmade websites were more intimate, there was a closer relationship between the creator (coder) and the audience. Readers could view, use, or rewrite the source code for their own projects. In contrast, today’s reliance on corporate platforms creates a greater distance between the user and the creator. For my project, this reading encourages me to treat my website as an intentional space. To create a website that values process, experimentation, and personal expression over polish or optimization. It allows me to create an online identity focused on self-expression, without prioritizing audience expectations.
